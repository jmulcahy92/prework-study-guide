        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to build a framework for webpages using elements such as text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, sometimes called "metadata," and is not visible to users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The available heading elements from largest to smallest are "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", and "h6". They should be used in order and "h1" should only be used once per page.</li>
          <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The "ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items respectively.</li>
          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The "br" element creates a line break between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The "a" element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. "A" in this context stands for "anchor."</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is used to define the style of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS means styling elements directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets set rules for the entire page by adding code in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External style sheets set rules for the entire page by writing code in a separate file and linking to that file in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Using external style sheets is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>CSS rules are formatted thusly: "selector {declaration1; declaration2; etc}"</li>
          <li>Declarations are formatted thusly: "property: value"</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the declarations apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations are the rules our HTML elements will follow.</li>
          <li>Examples of declarations are "color: blue" and "text-align: justify"</li>
          <li>The * symbol is used as a selector for all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>If one wishes to add declarations to some elements but not all of them, they can do so by designating a class attribute as the selector and then assigning that class attribute to the appropriate elements in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area; the "-A" flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit notes": creates a snapshot of the currently staged changes; the "-m" flag associates a message with our commit, which we use to scuuinctly describe the changes implemented</li>
          <li>git pull: receives a branch's modifications into the local environment; the "origin" keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo; the "main" keyword indicates the branch</li>
          <li>git push: pushes locally-made changes to the remote GitHub branch</li>
