        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to build a framework for webpages using elements such as text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, sometimes called "metadata," and is not visible to users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The available heading elements from largest to smallest are "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", and "h6". They should be used in order and "h1" should only be used once per page.</li>
          <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The "ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items respectively.</li>
          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The "br" element creates a line break between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The "a" element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. "A" in this context stands for "anchor."</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is used to define the style of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS means styling elements directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets set rules for the entire page by adding code in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External style sheets set rules for the entire page by writing code in a separate file and linking to that file in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Using external style sheets is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>CSS rules are formatted thusly: "selector {declaration1; declaration2; etc}"</li>
          <li>Declarations are formatted thusly: "property: value"</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the declarations apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations are the rules our HTML elements will follow.</li>
          <li>Examples of declarations are "color: blue" and "text-align: justify"</li>
          <li>The * symbol is used as a selector for all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>If one wishes to add declarations to some elements but not all of them, they can do so by designating a class attribute as the selector and then assigning that class attribute to the appropriate elements in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: navigates to a particular branch; adding a "-b" tag between "checkout" and "branch-name" creates a new branch with that name and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area; the "-A" flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit notes": creates a snapshot of the currently staged changes; the "-m" flag associates a message with our commit, which we use to scuuinctly describe the changes implemented</li>
          <li>git pull: receives a branch's modifications into the local environment; the "origin" keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo; the "main" keyword indicates the branch</li>
          <li>git push: pushes locally-made changes to the remote GitHub branch</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language used to make the webpage interactive.</li>
          <li>Like with external CSS style sheets, we link our JavaScript files within our HTML files. This is done in the body element rather than the head element.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>The "let" keyword is used to declare variables, which can then be assigned values. Note that JavaScript is case sensitive when naming your variables.</li>
          <li>Variables may hold values that have different data types, including strings (text), numbers, boolean values (true/false), and arrays. "Object" is a generic data type which includes all of the above data types as well as others.</li>
          <li>There are multiple data types used for handling different number types. It is important to understand the differences between these data types and their respective uses/weaknesses.</li>
          <li>A value is considered "falsy" if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered "truthy."</li>
          <li>Arrays are a way to store a group of related data in a single variable. Values stored in the array are given index values based on their position within the array.</li>
          <li>Loops are ways to continually repeat an instruction for a variety of values until a certain condition is reached without having to type instructions for each value individually. A common type of loop is the for loop.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. This is useful for documentation within code files.</li>
          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols that produce results based on two values or variables. This includes "+", "-", "*", "/", "=", "===", and "!==".</li>
          <li>Traditional arithmetic operators function more or less as expected.</li>
          <li>However, a single "=" is used to assign values to variables, while "===" is used to test whether two values are equal and returns a boolean value (true or false). The "!==" operator means "does not equal" and returns a boolean value as well.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the "if... else" statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are, on a basic level, a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a certain task. Functions are reusable, and therefore a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>Events are code structures that listen for activity in the browser and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. For JavaScript files, control flow dictates that scripts are executed from top to bottom.</li>
