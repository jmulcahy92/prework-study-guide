# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide for the prework of the Northwestern University coding bootcamp. Creating it allowed me to practice basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as I learned them. It also prompted me to take meticulous notes on these basics that I can now refer back to later.

This page is divided into four sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section contains notes on the relevant topic. Opening the DevTools console with Command+Option+I on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows shows these same sections in list format and suggests one at random to study first.
